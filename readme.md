# MiraiRichMessageParser
Providing support on extracting key information from rich messages.  
This project is based on project [mamoe/mirai](https://github.com/mamoe/mirai)  

---
Usage: Use [RichMessageParser](https://github.com/Under-estimate/MiraiRichMessageParser/tree/main/src/main/java/org/zrnq/RichMessageParser.java) to parse rich messages. If given a valid log destination, messages that cannot be parsed will be recorded there for further analysis.  
Attention: There exists numerous rich message types, so it's hard to cover every type. New types will be supported gradually.
